# CryptoBuyAdvisor

**An AI-powered crypto insight tool built on the AWS Free Tier.**
It doesnâ€™t just suggest what to buy; it warns you when to be cautious!

---

## Project Goals

CryptoBuyAdvisor is a cloud-native application that:
- Fetches real-time data from public crypto APIs
- Uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT API to provide natural-language recommendations
- Alerts users to risky or hype-driven coins (e.g., meme coins, cash-grab coins, etc)
- Is fully serverless and scalable using AWS Free Tier components

This project also prioritizes ethical crypto awarenessâ€”helping users understand not just *what* to buy, but *why* they should be cautious.

## DevOps & CI/CD Setup

CryptoBuyAdvisor is integrated with AWS CodePipeline (backend) and AWS Amplify (frontend) to enable continuous delivery.
- GitHub â†’ CodePipeline â†’ Lambda Deployment (planned)
  > *A change to `/backend/lambda_function.py` will automatically trigger redeployment once the pipeline is active.*
  
- GitHub â†’ AWS Amplify â†’ Website/App front (planned)
  > *A change to `/frontend/index.html` will automatically trigger redeployment once the pipeline is active.*
  
- Dev workflow is CI-ready for future integration with GitHub Actions

## Why I Built This

I recently passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate exam. This project puts those concepts into practice. My goal is to build something intelligent, scalable, and ethically responsible.
